Is it possible to extract music files from an old ipodr?

Yes, it is. However, when copied to your hard drive, files have
meaningless names, such as “ABCD.mp4”.

This package provides utilities to parse data returned by `mdls` such as
title, author, composer, and genre into a tidy data frame.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ipodr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andreranza/ipodr")
```
